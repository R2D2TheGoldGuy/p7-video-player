# Project 7 - Interative Video Player

Main Objective: Project 7 Challenge: Build an interactive video player that synchronizes the video and the transcript. The transcript should be placed below the video, and should highlight as the video progresses. When a user clicks any part of the transcript it should take them to the appropriate place in the video.

Note: These projects are intended to train you in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and let you practice and show your mastery of these fundamental building blocks of the web. Because of that, please avoid using frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton and so on for this project. Even though you may end up using frameworks like these professionally, you still need to know and be able to implement the designs with your own knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
